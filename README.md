# Numerics

A collection of project notebooks in Jupyter that I completed for a final-year BSc Course in Applied Mathematics. 

These notebooks deal with certain topics in **numerical analysis**:

- **lab1** is centred on numerical computation of eigenvalues, specifically via the Power method and Jacobi iterative method, with some fun warm-up exercises at the start
- **lab2** has some fun warm-up exercises again, then continues with numerical methods for computing eigenvalues, namely:
  - Givens Method
  - Householder Method
  - QR method without shifting
  - QR with shifting
- **lab3** has some cool warm-ups again, then goes into function approximation via
  - Chebyshev polynomials, and
  - Gaussian quadrature
 - The **assignments** are tests we did in class combining all these methods, written under test conditions with time limits :)
